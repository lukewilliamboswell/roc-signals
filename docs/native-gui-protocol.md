# Native GUI presentation boundary

The statically linked GUI boundary uses protocol version **3**. Zig exports
`signals_protocol_version` and `signals_node_size`; Rust checks both before
mount. This version replaces copied child arrays with indexed child queries and
adds virtual-list metadata. Both sides must be rebuilt together.
The browser protocol and its version are unchanged.

`Gui` lowers native presentation through the shared scalar descriptor machinery.
Text field **8** is `native_style`, field **9** is `native_viewport`, and boolean
field **4** is `selected`. The unused
IDs 7 and 3 remain the existing custom text/bool field markers. Native fields
are explicit protocol fields, not CSS, class names, test identifiers, or custom
attribute conventions. The browser rejects them before reserving or staging a
command batch. Native specs retain them through the ordinary render publication.
The native context also prepares a browser-shaped journal for shared structural
bookkeeping; these native fields publish only through its typed native
publication and never acquire invented browser opcodes.

The style field contains a canonical ASCII decimal record separated by commas:

```
version,direction,gap,padding,width_kind,width,height_kind,height,grow,background,foreground,border_color,border_width,radius,font_size,overflow_x,overflow_y
```

Version 1 has exactly these 17 fields. Numbers have no signs, whitespace, or
leading zeroes. Direction is row=0 or column=1. Length kind is auto=0, fill=1,
pixels=2; auto/fill must have a zero value. Grow is 0 or 1. Overflow is
visible=0, clip=1, scroll=2. Colors are 24-bit RGB or 16777216 for inherited/default.
Lengths, spacing, radius, borders, and font size are logical pixels, bounded at
16384. Font size zero inherits. Invalid records are programmer-contract errors,
not a request to substitute defaults. Records are bounded at 192 bytes.

The public `Gui.Style` contains typed lengths, colors and overflow tags. Only the
platform encoder creates records. `Gui.row`/`column`/`panel` choose direction;
`Gui.style` and `style_s` describe the remaining fields. Each element accepts one
style attribute. A supplied style replaces the helper's complete default style.
The style signal is an ordinary typed, equality-pruned signal; there is no
native styling observer graph.

Zig validates the style during native publication preparation and exports an
`extern` struct of 16 `u32` fields in the order after `version` above. Rust copies
this validated record along with primitive fields and borrowed UTF-8 data before
any next engine operation. Rust applies the supplied layout and presentation
properties with GPUI. Selected state adds the standard selection border, and
disabled state applies reduced opacity and refuses input dispatch.

`signals_dispatch` accepts event ID, payload kind, UTF-8 pointer/length, and a
boolean word. Kind 0 is unit, kind 1 is text, kind 2 is checked boolean; boolean
payloads require zero text bytes and a value of 0 or 1. Unit payloads require
zero text bytes and a zero boolean word; text payloads require valid UTF-8 and
a zero boolean word. Each kind uses the shared
engine's existing event extraction descriptor and capability-owned reducer path.
Deferred callbacks validate both node identity and current binding, and cannot
update disposed or rebound controls.

Input labels are both visible captions and semantic metadata. Semantic roles,
names, and test IDs support native specs and GPUI test selectors. They do not
establish Linux screen-reader support: the pinned GPUI dependency does not expose
an operating-system accessibility tree.

`Gui.virtual_list({row_height, follow_tail}, attrs, children)` presents direct
children at a fixed logical height. `Ui.each` retains its ordinary key and scope
semantics; scrolling changes GPUI layout work, not which reactive scopes exist.
The `native_viewport` field is a separate canonical record
`1,row_height,follow_tail`: height is 1–16384 and follow-tail is 0 or 1. The record
is bounded at 32 bytes. Rust receives two validated `u32` fields, both zero when
the viewport field is absent. An ordinary style update does not remove viewport
metadata.

The live GUI executor applies already-decided child edits to a prepared indexed
order, sharing the engine's order-index implementation while keeping element
and row identities distinct. Sparse edits copy changed index paths; full
snapshot replacement explicitly visits the replaced child set. Failure during
preparation leaves the prior order intact. Publication allocates nothing, and
empty or removed parent indexes are retired. The native semantic spec runner
continues to retain its observed DOM representation.

`signals_read_changed` exports a child count rather than a child pointer.
`signals_child_at(parent, rank)` returns one committed child in logarithmic
expected time; invalid ranks and calls outside the mount lifetime are contract
errors. The UI thread cannot interleave propagation while consuming a render
range. No viewport request scans preceding siblings, copies a full child list,
or changes application state. Rust retains node entities and renders only the
requested viewport range; ordinary containers enumerate their direct children
when they render. Fixed-height row caches preserve retained subtree identity.

Follow-tail positions the final matching row at the bottom when the list is
updated while enabled. Turning it off leaves scrolling under user control.
This is presentation policy, not a second timer, observer, or reactive graph.
